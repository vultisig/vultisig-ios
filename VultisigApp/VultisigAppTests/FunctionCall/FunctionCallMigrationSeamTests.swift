//
//  FunctionCallMigrationSeamTests.swift
//  VultisigAppTests
//
//  `FunctionCallType.migratedTransactionType(coin:nodeAddress:)` is the one
//  statement of which operations have moved to
//  `Features/FunctionTransaction/`. Both producers read it: the action list
//  asks it to decide a row's destination, and the legacy details screen still
//  asks it on selection change behind the dropdown that no entry point opens
//  any more.
//
//  These pin the mapping itself, the coin it pins an operation to, and the
//  reachability rule that outlived the dropdown: a migrated operation dropped
//  from the chain's case list disappears from the list too, because the
//  catalog is built from `getCases`.
