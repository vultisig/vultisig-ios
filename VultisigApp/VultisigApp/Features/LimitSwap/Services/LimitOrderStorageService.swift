    /// ⚠️ That last guard is what stops this becoming a delayed version of the

    /// bucket does nothing; hours later the order expires on its own and leaves
    /// the queue. Without the TTL check, that closure would be credited to the
    /// cancel and reported as a successful cancellation — telling the user their
    /// cancel worked when it silently failed and the order ran to expiry. An
    /// order that reached a terminal state on its own reached it on its own, and
    /// an outstanding cancel intent does not get to claim credit. Same reasoning
    /// as `.filled` above.
    ///
    /// The cancel is credited ONLY when the order provably could not have
    /// expired on its own — i.e. its TTL still has not elapsed at the moment we
    /// observe the closure. Anything else stays `.refunded`.
    ///
    /// The reasoning is about what the evidence can actually support. A closure
    /// is observed somewhere in the window between the last time we saw the
    /// order resting and the poll that found it gone. If the TTL end falls
    /// inside that window, expiry and cancellation are **indistinguishable** —
    /// the order could have expired a minute before our cancel landed, or the
    /// cancel could have closed it a minute before the TTL. Nothing reachable
    /// from a client separates them: `EventLimitSwapClose` carries the reason
    /// and reaches no REST route and no Midgard index.
    ///

    /// case is defined to mean — *"the funds came back, the observable fact"*,
    /// explicitly distinct from `.expired`, which `LimitOrderStatus` documents
    /// as "a claim about WHY". Claiming `.expired` here would be the same
    /// overclaim as claiming `.cancelled`, pointed the other way; the honest
    /// answer is the one that asserts only what was seen.
    ///
    /// The cost is that a genuine cancellation observed long after the fact —
    /// the app reopened days later — reads "Refunded" rather than "Cancelled".
